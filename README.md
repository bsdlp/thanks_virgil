### Steam put up your favorite game for free.

What do we do now? Matchmaking doesn't work because all of the
official and vanilla dedicated servers are taken. You now only have
the choice of playing on janky-ass modded servers, servers in Africa,
or local servers hosted by your friend in Florida.

We can help!

### Requirements

Really easy. You need `python2`, `virtualenv`, `pip`.

To do the needful:

```
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
