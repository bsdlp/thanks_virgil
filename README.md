### Description

This is a Flask web application with ansible support to deploy srcds servers
using your favorite virtual server provider (Linode). srcds servers are a huge
pain in the butt to deploy, so this project aims to provide an easy and fast
way to get from zero to gaming with one click.

### Requirements

Really easy. You need `python2`, `virtualenv`, `pip`.

To do the needful:

```
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
